# Satellite Ansible Roles

Ansible Roles to setup / configure Red Hat Satellite. The roles will be created using [foreman-ansible-modules](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules) or FAM.

Note: The roles here are not officially supported by Red Hat.

## Rules for contributing Roles to this project

* The use cases supported by the roles should be beneficial for many users.
* Input variables externalized in `vars` folder for easy reuse.
* The roles should be compatible with the currently (upstream) supported Ansible versions, 2.7+ at the time of writing.
* The roles should be compatible with any Python supported by Ansible upstream (2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 at the time of writing), however, roles usually donâ€™t require any special Python features (in contrast to modules).
* The roles should be compatible with the latest released version of the FAM collection (0.3.0 at the time of writing). While defining a dependency on an older FAM release is possible, it is discouraged.
* The roles shall not use hammer via command/shell or the uri module to talk to the API directly.
* The roles should not duplicate functionality of other existing roles in the same repository.
* The roles should be in the form that is ready to be pushed to Galaxy.
